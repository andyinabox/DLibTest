This is an openFrameworks project, for testing the integration with DLib.
Now it just performs DLib's face landmark detection on either live video or still pictures.

You must clone this project into OF_DIR/apps/WhicheverFolder/

You need the shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat file which you can download from [http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2](http://dlib.net/files/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat.bz2).
Once downloaded decompress and place in the bin/data folder.
